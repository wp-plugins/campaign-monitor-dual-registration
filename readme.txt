Automatically add new Wordpress users to your mailing list on Campaign Monitor. 

== Description ==

This plugin automatically adds new Wordpress users to your Campaign Monitor list. 

* The moment a user is added to WordPress, its email address (and optionally) user-meta data will be copied to Campaign Monitor.
* Also, when user data is changed, the modifications will be sent to Campaign Monitor
* Changes on Campaign Monitor can be reflected back to the user list, to use this feature one needs to define webhooks on the Campaign Monitor website. 

= Relation to our Campaign Monitor Synchronization plugin =

Our plugin [Campaign Monitor Synchronization](http://wordpress.org/plugins/campaign-monitor-synchronization) also adds WordPress users to Campaign Monitor, but it uses a more strict synchronization mechanism. For instance, it also removes users from the Campaign Monitor list when they do not exist as Wordpress users. For a lot of use cases this behavior is too rigorous, therefore we created this new plugin.
