Subscribe new Wordpress user to your mailing list on Campaign Monitor. 

== Description ==

This plugin automatically adds new Wordpress users to Campaign Monitor. Modifications on the Campaign Monitor list can be copied back to the Wordpress list, this is not yet documented. 

= Relation to our Campaign Monitor Synchronization plugin =

This plugin is written as an alternative for our plugin "Campaign Monitor Synchronization". It keeps both lists in full sync, where the WordPress user list is the master. For a lot of use cases this behavior is too rigorous, therefore we created this new plugin.
